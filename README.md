The MemCard PRO, in conjunction with the XStation ODE mod, is able to detect which game is currently running on your PlayStation 1. This simple python script displays this information via Discord Rich Presence.

# Usage

Before using this, you need to have set up your MemCard PRO's web server as per the MCP's instructions. You can then set the IP address of the MCP's local web server in config.txt if necessary.
